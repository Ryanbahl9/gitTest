	<h1>Section 6 - List Collections (and a Sort Key Trick)</h1>
	<h2> 8B.6.1&nbsp; Linked List Collections</h2>
	<p> We now reproduce our <em><strong>linked list</strong></em> of <strong>floats</strong> using the <strong>list template</strong> to assist us.&nbsp; Before you   break open a bottle of champagne, I should tell you that there is no magic   method that works like our previous <strong>insert()</strong>, which places a new element   in its proper position in the list.&nbsp; We have to do a little work to get   that functionality, even with <em><strong>Collections Framework's Linked Lists</strong></em> so be forewarned.&nbsp; <strong>Lists</strong> only give us something similar to our <strong>insertAfter()</strong> and <strong>deleteAfter()</strong> (through the <strong>ListIterator</strong> methods <strong>add()</strong> and <strong>remove()</strong>). The logic of ordering   the list must be supplied by us.&nbsp; You might be thinking that (when we get   there, shortly) you can use <strong>PriorityQueue's   add() and remove().</strong>&nbsp; Sort-of.&nbsp; <strong>PriorityQueue</strong> is not really   putting anything into the list in order -- it is merely <em>removing</em> things   in order, which is a different idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, our current   effort will help solidify <strong>ListIterators</strong> and moving through a <strong> LinkedList</strong>.</p>
	<p> In short, we will declare a <strong>LinkedList</strong> of <strong>Floats</strong> (wrapper of <strong>float</strong>) in a single   statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will give us all the functionality of our custom <strong> FloatList</strong> class <font color="#FF0000"><em>except</em></font> for the powerful <strong>insert()</strong> and <strong>remove()</strong> methods.&nbsp; We will write two   global-scope methods <strong>insert()</strong> and <strong>remove()</strong> to accomplish this (and   also a global <strong>showList()</strong> for output).&nbsp; In the<strong> insert()</strong> and <strong> remove()</strong> (and <strong>showList()</strong>) we will naturally use <strong>ListIterators</strong> to help us run through the list.&nbsp;In practice, you would   encapsulate <strong>insert(), remove()</strong> and <strong>showList() </strong>in the proper class, but for now, let's put these methods into the client at pseudo-global scope (in the Foothill class as helpers). </p>

	<h4>Notes</h4>
	<p>If you look carefully, you'll see that I intentionally added duplicates to the list so we could see that <strong>ListIterator</strong>'s<strong> remove()</strong> only deletes <em>one</em> element (the first it finds). This parallels our <strong>remove()</strong>'s intention.</p>
	<p>In <strong>insert()</strong> we specify the <strong>ListIterator&lt;Float&gt;</strong> instead of   just <strong>ListIterator</strong> so that we can use the item   returned by the <strong>iter.next()</strong> as if it were a <strong>Float</strong> (and even better, through <em><strong>automatic un-boxing</strong></em>, we can use it as it if were a <strong>float</strong>). This can be seen in   these statements:</p>

<pre>     float listX = iter.next();
     if (x &lt;= listX)
</pre>

	<p>In the original incarnation of <strong>insert()</strong>, we "stood   back" one node so we could use <strong>insertAfter()</strong> and prevent our list pointer from   going too far ahead in the list (for details you can review those modules).&nbsp;   We have a better way to do that now - we can use the <strong>ListIterator's previous()</strong> method to back up one.&nbsp; That's just what we do.&nbsp; When we find the   position in the list, we have actually moved past it, so we simply back-up one:</p>

<pre>     listX = iter.next();
     if (x &lt;= listX)
     {
        iter.previous(); // back up one
        break;
     }
</pre>

	<ul>
		<li><strong><font color="#808000">The Good News:</font></strong>&nbsp; This works just like our hard-fought custom <strong>FloatList</strong> class.&nbsp; We sacrificed nothing. (Compare the run with before -   	it's identical.)</li>
		<li><font color="#808000"><strong>More Good News:</strong></font> The<strong> insert()</strong> and <strong>remove()</strong> methods were actually easier to write than before - we   	didn't need to stand back one node in anticipation of the awkard <strong>insertAfter()</strong> and <strong>deleteAfter()</strong> calls.</li>
		<li><strong><font color="#FF0000">The Bad News:</font></strong> We had to write   	methods and do some work.&nbsp; Oh well.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>8B.6.2 Multiple Sort Fields</h2>
	<p>The above analysis of a sorted list assumes we have a <strong>&lt;= </strong>and<strong> == operator</strong> defined for the underlying   object type.&nbsp; With <strong>floats</strong> (and <strong>Floats</strong> via auto-unboxing) this is a no-brainer.&nbsp;  We can also use define and use a <strong>compareTo()</strong> if we prefer not to use operator overloading.</p>
	<p> <em>However, when we have data that has <strong>multiple members</strong>, any one of   which we may want to use as a basis for our<strong> compareTo()</strong>, we have to decide which   one to use.</em>&nbsp;</p>
	<p> If there is only one good choice,  the solution is easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But what if we want to order the list on different members in different clients?</p>
	<h4>It works like this:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Define some <strong>public static final ints</strong> (or <strong>enums</strong>)&nbsp; that   	the client can use to describe what kind of sort it wants.&nbsp; For   	example, in an <strong>iTunesEntry</strong> class, these constants might be called:&nbsp; <strong>SORT_BY_TITLE</strong>,  <strong> SORT_BY_ARTIST</strong> and <strong>SORT_BY_TIME</strong>.&nbsp; This establishes the   	language for our solution.</li>
		<li>Define a <strong>static private member sortKey</strong> which will be exactly one of   	the above constants at any time.&nbsp; For example, if we are going to sort by   	artist, then the value of <strong>nSortKey</strong> will be set to the  value <strong>SORT_BY_ARTIST</strong>.</li>
		<li>Define a <em><strong>static mutator</strong></em> method called something like <strong>setSortType()</strong> which takes   	one of those constants as an argument and sets the <strong>sortKey</strong> member   	accordingly. A client would call
		
<pre> iTunesEntry.setSortType(iTunesEntry.SortType.SORT_BY_ARTIST);
</pre>

</li>
		<li>Add a <strong>compareTo()</strong> method within the class (or outside as a <strong>Comparable</strong>) to work based on the selected <strong>sortKey</strong>.&nbsp; </li>
	</ol>
	<p>At any time you compare two objects using syntax like <span class="codeInLine">obj_1.compareTo(obj2)</span>,  it will give the answer based on the  active sort key.</p>
	<h2>8B.6.3 iTunesEntry</h2>
	<p>Here is a hypothetical class, <strong>iTunesEntry</strong>, that has the following members:</p>

<pre>public class iTunesEntry implements Comparable&lt;iTunesEntry&gt;
{
   private String title, artist;
   private int totalTime;
   
   // ... rest of class omitted
}
</pre>

	<p> There are two <strong>Strings</strong> and one <strong>int</strong>, and we might want our list   sorted by the artist's name (<strong>artist</strong>) one day, on the title (<strong>title</strong>)   on another day and the play time (<strong>totalTime</strong>) on yet a third day.&nbsp;   Following the above plan, we first define the static int symbols and the private   static as in <em><strong>steps 1 and 2</strong></em>:</p>

<pre>public class iTunesEntry implements Comparable&lt;iTunesEntry&gt;
{
   // ... various members, then
   
   public enum SortType { SORT_BY_TITLE, SORT_BY_ARTIST, SORT_BY_TIME };
   
   private static SortType sortKey = SortType.SORT_BY_ARTIST;
      
   // ... then the rest 
};
</pre>

	<p> The static <strong>sortKey</strong> is the member that remembers what our sort key is   at any given moment.&nbsp; We could define our sort types using <strong>static private   int,</strong> but doing so with more than two or three constants is tedious.&nbsp;   Therefore, we often use the <strong>enum</strong> type, which accomplishes the exact same   thing - <strong>enums</strong> are <strong>ints</strong>.&nbsp; The above syntax for the <strong>enum</strong> <strong>SortType</strong> causes <strong>SORT_BY_TITLE = 0,   SORT_BY_ARTIST = 1,</strong> etc. We covered all this in the first week if you need a refresher.</p>
	<p>We now know what to call the "idea" of wanting to sort by artist:&nbsp; we   call it <strong>iTunesEntry.SortType.SORT_BY_ARTIST</strong>.&nbsp; The client can use this same symbol   when it wants to talk to our class about the sort type it wishes to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that we gave <strong>sortKey</strong>  an initial   value (a step you don't want to omit).</p>
	<p>So far, so good.&nbsp; Next, <em><strong>step 3</strong></em>:&nbsp; define a <em><strong>static mutator</strong></em>.&nbsp;   This can be used by any client to change the value of <strong>sortKey</strong>.&nbsp;   Like any good <em><strong>mutator</strong></em>, it must filter bad data.</p>

<pre>   public static boolean setSortType( SortType whichType )
   {
      switch (whichType)
      {
      case SORT_BY_TITLE:
      case SORT_BY_ARTIST:
      case SORT_BY_TIME:
         sortKey = whichType;
         return true;
      default:
         return false;
      }
   }
</pre>

	<p> <em><strong>Step 4</strong></em> completes the picture: we have to make sure this member is actually used when   we do a comparison.&nbsp; At a minimum, add a <strong>compareTo()</strong> method to the class (if you have access -- otherwise, you'll need either add this in a subclass or  create a <strong>Comparator</strong> as described in the next seection).</p>

<pre>   public int compareTo(iTunesEntry other)
   {
      switch (sortKey)
      {
      case SORT_BY_TITLE:
         return (title.compareToIgnoreCase(other.title));
      case SORT_BY_ARTIST:
         // get last name from string
         // stack the last name before the first - no worries about trailing last
         return (getArtistLastName() + artist).compareToIgnoreCase(
            other.getArtistLastName() + other.getArtist() );

      case SORT_BY_TIME:
         return (totalTime - other.totalTime);
      default:
         return 0;
      }
   }
</pre>

	<p>A client would use this <strong>compareTo()</strong> in its sorts, list insertion searches, etc.</p>
	<h3>equals()</h3>
	<p>Finally, an important note about <strong>equals()</strong>. Typically, this is not about <em>ordering</em>, but about <em>member-by-member comparisons</em>. You should be well aware of this by now. Why bring it up in a discussion about ordering? On occasion, one might wish  <strong>equals() </strong>to be defined in terms of <strong>compareTo()</strong>, which is defined in terms of the <strong>sortKey</strong>. Understand that this is a weaker equality than member-wis e equality, and if you don't understand what I mean, think about it and discuss it in the forums.</p>
	<p>Well, we now have set up our <strong>iTunesEntry</strong> class to have a totally flexible <strong>compareTo()</strong> mechanism.&nbsp;  After that, you can   build <strong>greater()</strong>, <strong>less()</strong>,  <strong>equalTo()</strong>, or even overload <strong>equals()</strong> on top of these methods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, you can   get by with just  <strong>compareTo()</strong>.</p>
	<p>The client changes the sort key using one simple statement:</p>

<pre>	// set the sort key to song duration
  iTunesEntry.setSortType(iTunesEntry.SortType.SORT_BY_TIME);
</pre>

	<p>Once this is done, we can apply any function or algorithm that uses the &lt;   operator, and it will be done based on time ordering.</p>
	<h2>8B.6.4 iTunes Client With Multiple Sort Keys</h2>
	<p>Here is an example client that uses the above technique.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can   ignore the first part that reads the <strong>iTunesEntry</strong> data from the file.&nbsp;   Concentrate on the methods that we have modified from the <strong>float</strong> version.&nbsp;   We made some minor adjustments so that they work now with <strong>iTunesEntry</strong> objects.</p>

    <p>Note that the first list is ordered by time, and the second by title, just as   we had expected.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Also notice that, besides changing the type parameter from float to <strong> iTunesEntry</strong>, we did not touch the<strong> insert()</strong> or <strong>remove()</strong> methods.&nbsp; So these can easily be turned into function templates and never   written again.&nbsp; Wow.</p>
    <h3>A More  Complete Listing</h3>
    <p>Here is the  listing for <strong>iTunesEntry</strong>, but I do not provide  the necessary class (<strong>iTunesEntryReader</strong>) that reads the data from a file, so you won't be able to run it, as is.
