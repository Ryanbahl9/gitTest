  	<h1>Section 2 - Swing Applets</h1>
	<h2> 6A.2.1 JApplets</h2>
	<p> Usually, programmers choose to work with the <strong>Swing</strong> components <strong>JButton,   JTextArea</strong>, etc. because they are lightweight and have more functionality   than the older <strong>AWT</strong> components.&nbsp; That's why we use <strong>Swing</strong> components   in these courses.&nbsp; It is also why we will use <strong>JApplets</strong> instead of <strong> Applets</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>JApplets</strong> are used in very much the same way as <strong>Applets</strong>.&nbsp;   In fact, now that you know about inheritance, I can tell you that <strong>JApplets</strong> are derived from <strong>Applets</strong>, and therefore inherit all of their public   behavior and methods. Therefore, the <strong>init() </strong>and<strong> paint()</strong> methods   are still there for us.</p>
	<p>Here is a reproduction of the first <strong>Swing</strong> GUI that we did the first week --   the 'brain dead" Transporter.&nbsp; I've added a <strong>drawString()</strong> to it to   help demonstrate how to combine <strong>JComponents</strong> with the <strong> Graphics</strong> instance methods like <strong>drawString().</strong></p>

<pre>import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class Foothill extends JApplet
{
   JLabel lblMyLabel;
   JTextField txtMyTextArea;
   JButton btnMyButton;
   
   public void init()
   {
      // control the size of the applet
      setSize(300, 200);
      // set up layout which will control placement of buttons, etc.
      FlowLayout layout = new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER, 5, 20);  
      setLayout(layout);

      // 3 controls: a label, a text field and a button
      lblMyLabel = new JLabel("Friend's Name: ");
      txtMyTextArea = new JTextField(10);
      btnMyButton = new JButton("Press Here to See Friend");
      
      // place your 3 controls onto applet
      add(lblMyLabel);
      add(txtMyTextArea);
      add(btnMyButton);
   }
   public void paint(Graphics g)
   {
      paintComponents(g);
      g.drawString("(An applet version of Transporter)", 40, 180);
   }
}
</pre>

	<p>It yields this:</p>
	<div class="picCenter"><img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 2_files/pic_1b6_3.jpg" alt="GUI shot" width="307" height="276" border="0"></div>
	<p>Because there are no event handlers, there is no behavior.&nbsp; However   notice that if you cover and then reveal this applet window with something on   your desktop, the <strong>JComponents</strong> and <strong>drawString()</strong> text are redrawn.&nbsp; This is   something you cannot take for granted with <strong>JApplets</strong>, and the secret is inside   our <strong>paint()</strong> method:</p>
<pre>   public void paint(Graphics g)
   {
      paintComponents(g);
      g.drawString("(An applet version of Transporter)", 40, 180);  
   }
</pre>
	
	<p>You see that there is a new, mysterious, call to <strong>paintComponents(</strong>).&nbsp;   This is needed in <strong>JApplets</strong>.&nbsp; It does what <strong>drawString()</strong> does - replaces the   beautiful window as it was when we created it.</p>
	<p>If you experiment with this and change the order of the two lines in the <strong>paint() </strong>method, what happens?&nbsp; Why?</p>
	<p>Incidentally, you do not call your <strong>paint</strong>() method directly. This is   done for you as needed. But what if you want to <u>force</u> a refresh? Your user   has changed a value on some electrical simulator applet and you want to redraw   the circuit even though there has been no damage to the window. This is easy.   There is a method called <strong>repaint</strong>() that you use to ask Java to call <strong> paint</strong>() for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can issue <strong>repaint()</strong> from any method, even a   constructor or <strong>init()</strong>.</p>
