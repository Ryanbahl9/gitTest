  	<h1>Section 1 - Events and Listeners</h1>
	<h2>5B.1.1 Handling GUI Events</h2>
	<p>Our immediate challenge is to get this stubborn program to respond when we   push the <strong>Push Here to See Friend </strong>button.&nbsp; For this we will need to   define a new <em><strong>class</strong></em>.&nbsp; Luckily, we learned about creating <em> <strong>classes</strong></em> last week, so this is going to be easy.</p>
	<p>When we press the button now, we will get the following kind of response from   the program:</p>
	<div class="picCenter"><img src="./CS 1B Module 5B Section 1_files/pic_1a10_20.jpg" alt="GUI shot" width="519" height="235" border="2"></div>
	<p>First some vocabulary.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><font color="#800080">Controls - </font></strong>The various GUI objects   	on our <strong>JFrame</strong> are called <em><strong>controls</strong></em>. The<strong> JLabel,   	JButton </strong>and<strong> JTextField</strong> are three types of <em><strong>controls</strong></em> that we give the user as a means of interacting with the program.&nbsp; A   	control can be almost anything that appears on our <strong>JFrame</strong>.</li>
		<li><font color="#800080"><strong>Events</strong></font> - When we do something to one   	of the controls, like push a <strong>JButton</strong> or type some text into a <strong> JTextField</strong>, we are generating an <em><strong>event</strong></em>.&nbsp; Some <em><strong> events</strong></em> will cause our program to take actions, while others will be   	ignored&nbsp; We decide what to listen for and what to ignore.&nbsp; For   	example, we certainly want to listen for a button press event, but we may   	not care if the user types a single character into a text field.&nbsp;   	Still, typing a character, even without hitting the enter key, is an <em><strong>event</strong></em>, and some programs will listen for   	that <em><strong>event</strong></em>.</li>
		<li><font color="#800080"><strong>Listeners</strong></font> - A class that we create   	which is intended to respond to an <em><strong>event</strong></em> is called a <em><strong> listener</strong></em> <em><strong>class</strong></em>.&nbsp; We supply<em><strong> listener classes</strong></em> only for those events that we care about.&nbsp; Inside the<em><strong> listener   	classes</strong></em> we handle the events.&nbsp; <em><strong>Listeners</strong></em> refer to   	the <em><strong>classes</strong></em> that we create to handle <em><strong>events</strong></em>.</li>
		<li><font color="#800080"><strong>Event Handlers</strong></font> - The method that is   	called as a result of a particular event occurring is called an <strong><em>e</em></strong><em><strong>vent   	handler</strong></em>.&nbsp; All <em><strong>event handlers</strong></em> must be defined   	inside<em><strong> listener classes</strong></em>.&nbsp; Therefore, an <em><strong>event handler</strong></em> is   	a method inside some <em><strong>listener class</strong></em>.&nbsp; (Some programmers   	call these event handlers "callbacks" which is an antiquated carry-over from   	an old style of event programming.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you read ahead or look at other textbooks, you may find that some <em><strong> events</strong></em> seem to be <em><strong>handled</strong></em> using a strange syntax right in   our main or derived <strong>JFrame</strong> class without creating a special <em><strong>listener class</strong></em>.&nbsp;   This is a special short-cut called <em><strong>anonymous inner class listeners</strong></em>.&nbsp; Even though they appear to be handled   without creating separate<em><strong> listener classes</strong></em>, they really are separate classes.&nbsp;   They are simply nested inside the main class for convenience.</p>
	<h4>The process of getting our program to react to user events is:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><u><strong>Place the control</strong></u> somewhere in our container frame,   	usually in the <strong>JFrame</strong>. (We have already been doing this with the <strong> JFrame</strong> <strong>add()</strong> method.</li>
		<li><u><strong>Define the listener</strong></u> class that will handle the event for   	the control.&nbsp; Sometimes we have a separate <em><strong>listener class</strong></em> for each <em><strong>control</strong></em>, other times one <em><strong>listener</strong></em> services several   	controls.
			<ul>
				<li>These classes should normally be given a name and be nested within   		the main <strong>JFrame</strong> class (i.e., they should be <em><strong>inner classes</strong></em>)</li>
				<li>The classes must be declared on their top line as <em><strong>implementing</strong></em> a particular listener (e.g., <strong>ItemListener</strong>, <strong>ActionListener</strong>, <strong>KeyListener</strong>, etc).&nbsp; Which listener the class implements   		depends on which event we are trying to handle.</li>
				<li>These classes must contain a special <em><strong>event handler</strong></em> <em><strong>method</strong></em> that has a pre-determined name.&nbsp; The name will depend on the   		type of event it is to handle.</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li><u><strong>Register our listener</strong></u> with the <em><strong>control</strong></em> that   	it will listen to, i.e., the <em><strong>control</strong></em> whose <em><strong>events</strong></em> it will <em><strong>handle</strong></em>.&nbsp; This   	is done with a method call: <strong>addActionListener() </strong>or<strong> addItemListener()</strong>,   	for example.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>All of this requires that you import a new package into your program: <strong>&nbsp;java.awt.event.*.</strong></p>
	<h2>5B.1.2 ActionListeners</h2>
	<p>A common kind of event is an <em><strong>action event</strong></em>.&nbsp; This occurs   when a button is pressed or the user hits the enter key. To <em><strong>trap</strong></em> an action event   (that's a cool way to say to handle an action event) we define our listener   class so that it <strong>implements ActionListener</strong>.&nbsp; The <em><strong>event handler</strong></em> that   is associated with such a <em><strong>listener</strong></em> is called an <strong>actionPerformed()</strong> <em><strong> method</strong></em>.</p>
	<p>Here is the most important new concept with event handlers.&nbsp; We do not   call them directly as we have done with other methods.&nbsp; They are called for   us by the <strong>JVM</strong> or <strong>JRE</strong> during program execution<strong><em> if and when   the event occurs.</em></strong>&nbsp; </p>
	<p>What follows is an implementation of a listener class which I called <strong>SeeFriendListener</strong> because it is going to handle the <em><strong>push event</strong></em> of the <strong>JButton</strong>&nbsp; that&nbsp; bears the text <strong>"Push to See Friend."</strong>&nbsp; You will notice that I defined this class inside the <strong>TranspoFrame</strong> class and made sure that it implemented the <strong>ActionListener</strong> interface.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Compare this listing to the comments in this and the last section.&nbsp;   Run the program to see how it behaves.</p>

<pre>import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
   
public class Foothill 
{
 
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      // establish main frame in which program will run
      TranspoFrame myTranspoFrame 
            = new TranspoFrame("Transporter Room");
      myTranspoFrame.setSize(300, 200);
      myTranspoFrame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
      myTranspoFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
      
      // show everything to the user
      myTranspoFrame.setVisible(true);
   }
}

// TranspoFrame class is derived from JFrame class
class TranspoFrame  extends JFrame
{
   JButton btnMyButton;
   JTextField txtMyTextArea;
   JLabel lblMyLabel;
   
   // TranspoFrame constructor
   public TranspoFrame(String title)
   {
      // pass the title up to the JFrame constructor
      super(title);
      
      // set up layout which will control placement of buttons, etc.
      FlowLayout layout = new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER, 5, 20); 
      setLayout(layout);
      
      // 3 controls: a label, a text field and a button
      lblMyLabel = new JLabel("Friend's Name: ");
      txtMyTextArea = new JTextField(10);
      btnMyButton = new JButton("Press Here to See Friend"); 
      add(lblMyLabel);
      add(txtMyTextArea);
      add(btnMyButton);
      
      // create a Listener for the JButton and register it
      SeeFriendListener sfFriendListener;
      sfFriendListener = new SeeFriendListener();
      btnMyButton.addActionListener( sfFriendListener );
   }
   
   // inner class for JButton Listener
   class SeeFriendListener implements ActionListener
   {
      // event handler for JButton
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
      {
         String friend = txtMyTextArea.getText();
         JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, 
               "Please wait while we locate " + friend + "...");
      }
   } // end inner class SeeFriendListener
} // end class TranspoFrame
</pre>

	<p>This program is very similar to the last version.&nbsp; The only differences   are the inclusion of the <em><strong>inner listener class,</strong></em> and the registration of the    listener with the button.&nbsp; We can shorten it by combining these three   lines:</p>

<pre>   SeeFriendListener sfFriendListener;
   sfFriendListener = new SeeFriendListener();
   btnMyButton.addActionListener( sfFriendListener );
</pre>

	<p>into a single line:</p>

<pre>   btnMyButton.addActionListener( new SeeFriendListener() );
</pre>

		<h4>Notice that we are doing three new things relative to our previous version.</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>We are taking an action when the user clicks the button (this is the   	work of our event listener)</li>
		<li>We are reading data from the text field control (see the<strong> txtMyTextArea.getText()</strong> call)</li>
		<li>We are issuing a<strong> JOptionPane.showMessageDialog()</strong> from our <em><strong> event handler</strong></em> - thus putting&nbsp; up a new small message window as a   	result of the user doing something in our main JFrame window.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Some sloppy unfinished business includes making the member data private   (rather than default), and checking for bad user input in the text field.&nbsp;   We'll do those things in the next version.</p>
	<p>Obviously we haven't beamed our friend into the room yet, but at least now   the program is reacting to the user.&nbsp; Progress.</p>
