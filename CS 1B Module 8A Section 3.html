	<h1>Section 3 - Deriving a Float Class</h1>
	<h2>8A.3.1 Building From a Base Class</h2>
	<p>Let's say we wish to create a real, useful list of <strong>floats</strong> (actually <strong> doubles</strong>)&nbsp; from our generic   list of "nothings".&nbsp; As with the <strong>StackNodes</strong> and <strong>Stack</strong> data   structure, we first create a new node called <strong>FloatNode</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>FloatNode</strong> will be derived from <strong>Node</strong> and therefore will not   have to duplicate any data or linking methods.&nbsp; It only has to add the <strong>double</strong> data to it.&nbsp; That's what deriving classes is all about.</p>
	<p>This is exactly as we did when we extended the <strong>StackNode</strong> class, but   here we are extending our more general <strong>Node</strong> class.&nbsp; Here is the <strong> FloatNode</strong> class. </p>
	<div class="parenthetical">Note: I'm actually using <strong>doubles</strong> rather than <strong>floats</strong>.&nbsp; Often we use <strong>doubles</strong>, but informally call them <strong><em>floats</em></strong>, since <strong>double</strong> is a floating point data type.</div>
<pre>// imports go at the top of whatever .java file this appears.
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;

class FloatNode extends Node
{
   // additional data for subclass
   private double data;
   
   // constructor
   public FloatNode(double x)
   {
      super();  // constructor call to base class
      data = x;
   }
   
   // overriding show()
   public void show()
   {
      NumberFormat tidy = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US);
      tidy.setMaximumFractionDigits(4);
      
      System.out.print("[" + tidy.format(data) + "] ");
   }
   
   // accessor and mutator
   public double getData()
   {
      return data;
   }
   
   public boolean setData(double usrData)
   {
      // if there were a viable limitation we would test and return false if bad
      data = usrData;
      return true;
   }
}
</pre>

	<p>To repeat what I said several lessons before, it is derived from <strong>Node</strong>.&nbsp;   It has only one member, the <strong>double</strong> <strong>data</strong>.&nbsp; It has one constructor,   the usual accessors, and it overrides the <strong>show() </strong>method of the base class.&nbsp;&nbsp; I added some   fancy number formatting just to make sure the floats are printed out neatly, and   that could be omitted, to make the class even simpler.&nbsp; Notice how you have to   know absolutely NOTHING about the base class nodes.&nbsp; You only add the float data   and methods that manipulate that. <br>
	</p>
	<h2>8A.3.2 An Instant List of Floats</h2>
	<p>Guess what?&nbsp; We don't have to derive any other classes to start using a <strong>float</strong> list.&nbsp; We can use what we have immediately. Keep in mind this is   still a little unrealistic because the client below uses <strong>FloatNodes</strong> rather than   simple <strong>floats</strong> (the client shouldn't have to be bothered with the   existence of such esoteric types as <strong>FloatNodes</strong>), but it will be a good   test for your understanding of derived classes.</p>
	<p>In what follows, I assume the same multi-file project that we used with the <strong>StackNode</strong> and <strong>Stack</strong> examples.&nbsp; In other words I added classes   (and .java files) Node and List to the project and placed the code for <strong>Node</strong> and <strong>List</strong> into Node.java and List.java, respectively.</p>
	<p>Here is the main <strong>Foothill.java</strong> file, containing the derived class <strong> FloatNode</strong>, and a main that tests its functionality.</p>

<pre>import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;

public class Foothill
{
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      FloatNode fp;
      List myList = new List();
      int k;

      // build a data-less list by inserting 10 nodes at front
      for (k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++)
      {
         fp = new FloatNode(k);
         myList.insertAfterHead(fp);
      }
      myList.showList();

      // remove 5 nodes
      for (k = 0; k &lt; 5; k++)
         myList.removeAfterHead();   
      myList.showList();
   }
 }

class FloatNode extends Node
{
   // additional data for subclass
   private double data;
   
   // constructor
   public FloatNode(double x)
   {
      super();  // constructor call to base class
      data = x;
   }
   
   // overriding show()
   public void show()
   {
      NumberFormat tidy = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US);
      tidy.setMaximumFractionDigits(4);
      
      System.out.print("[" + tidy.format(data) + "] ");
   }
   
   // accessor and mutator
   public double getData()
   {
      return data;
   }
   
   public boolean setData(double usrData)
   {
      // if there were a viable limitation we would test and return false if bad
      data = usrData;
      return true;
   }
}
</pre>

	<p>We are using a <strong>FloatNode</strong> reference, fp to create the nodes that go into the   list because that is how we add actual numbers.</p>
	<p>You should be enjoying the magic of <strong><em>inheritance </em></strong>now.&nbsp; Without modifying the <strong>showList() </strong> method, our list of <strong>FloatNodes</strong> was printed to the screen.</p>
	<p>Study this example before going on to the next section (which has even cooler   things in it).</p>
