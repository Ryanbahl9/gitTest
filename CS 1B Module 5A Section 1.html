  	<h1>Section 1 - Problems with JOptionPane</h1>
  	<h3>Introduction to Week Five</h3>
<p>This week we  will review true GUI programming covered in <span class="sectionOrAssignmentTitle">CS 1A</span>. Everything through <span class="sectionOrAssignmentTitle">Module 5B.4</span> is review. Starting <span class="sectionOrAssignmentTitle">Module 5B.5</span>, you will see new material that integrates our stack data structure and multi-file project techniques of last week with GUI programming.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
	<p>The optional textbook reading is handled as we have been doing all along:  look up the terms with which you want more coverage in the index and see where it leads. The links in early modules on the Swing, and other GUI packages become particularly relevant at this time.</p>
	<h2>5A.1.1 JOptionPane.showMessageDialog()</h2>
	<p>To see an easy pseudo-GUI format, let's modify   a console program by changing all the <strong>println()</strong> calls to <strong>showMessageDialog()</strong> calls. (I'll let you deduce what the original console program must have looked like.)</p>

<pre>import javax.swing.*;

public class Foothill 
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      int someNumber;
  
      someNumber = -7;
      someNumber = (someNumber-2)/3;
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "someNumber is " + someNumber);
         
      // just some more stuff to demo / and %
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "\n-7 divided by 2 is " 
         + (-7 / 2)  );
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "\n-7 mod 2 is " 
         + (-7 % 2)  );
   }
}
</pre>

	<p>When you run this, you'll notice that between each <strong>showMessageDialog()</strong> method call,   the user must click <strong>OK</strong> to move the program   execution forward.</p>

	<p>What about the<strong> '\n'?</strong>&nbsp; In the console app we needed it to cause output to   be placed on a new line.&nbsp; But here each output statement emits a new   message dialog box, so it is unnecessary.&nbsp; We can remove the '<strong>\n'</strong>s from the   program.&nbsp; But just to see how closely you are following along, what effect,   if any, do these '<strong>\n'</strong>s have in this GUI version of our program?</p>
	<p>Can you see now, why sometimes the less beautiful <em><strong>console apps</strong></em> are more   convenient if we have a large quantity of output?</p>
	<h2>5A.1.2 Not Quite a GUI ... Yet</h2>
	<p>Actually, what we just did is not truly GUI.&nbsp;   Placing a bunch of <strong>showMessageDialogs</strong> onto the screen in rapid succession   is really just a confused form of mixing console and graphics.&nbsp; To do   things right, we have to learn the proper way to do GUI, and that's what   we study next.</p>
