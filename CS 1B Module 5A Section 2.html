    <h1>Section 2&nbsp; - New School GUIs</h1>
    <h2>5A.2.1 Magic with Java<img src="./CS 1B Module 5A Section 2_files/pic_1a10_17.jpg" alt="screen shot" width="300" height="200" hspace="9" border="0" align="right"></h2>
    <p>I've been holding out on you. Java can do absolutely incredible things, but   I've been boring you with numbers and arithmetic.</p>
    <p>What if you could push a button and see any one of your friends, any time,   night or day?&nbsp;Of course, with <em><strong>Skype</strong></em> and <em><strong>FaceTime</strong></em>, this doesn't sound very innovative, but I'm talking about actually teleporting them into your room.&nbsp; Today we will learn how to write the GUI you see above.&nbsp;   Nothing fancy... simply type your friend's name into the upper text box, go comb   your hair and rinse your mouth with mouthwash, and when you're ready, come   back and click the button "Press Here to See Friend".</p>
    <p>In the next few pages, we will learn how to do this.&nbsp; First we look at   the <strong>Swing</strong> library.</p>
    <h2>5A.2.2 The Swing Windows Library</h2>
    <p>Java tools are grouped in   functional units called <em><strong>packages</strong></em>.&nbsp; In the pseudo-  GUI <em><strong></strong></em>program of the last section, we had to include an <strong>import</strong> statement at the top:<strong> import javax.swing.*</strong>. That was to bring in a GUI support <em><strong>package</strong></em> called <strong>Swing</strong>.&nbsp; We needed <strong>Swing</strong> in order to use the <strong>JOptionPane</strong> <em><strong>class</strong></em> that we   used to display the message dialog.</p>
    <p>There are other <em><strong>packages</strong></em> that we'll need as we progress.&nbsp; But this   package serves a large group of GUI <em><strong>classes</strong></em> and <em><strong>methods</strong></em> that help us draw GUI   onto the screen. You can usually tell which <em><strong>classes</strong></em> belong to this package   because their names begin with the letter capital "J" ... <strong>&nbsp;JOptionPane</strong>, for   example.&nbsp; We're about to learn a few other classes in the <strong>Swing</strong> library.</p>
