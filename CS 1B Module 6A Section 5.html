  	<h1>Section 5 - The Drawing on JPanels</h1>
	<h2>6A.5.1 Drawing on JPanels</h2>
	<p>There are two types of colored light that radiate off GUI applications:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><em><strong>Controls</strong></em> (buttons, labels, text areas, etc.)</li>
		<li>Unstructured drawing (or just <em><strong>drawing</strong></em>).</li>
	</ol>
	<p><em><strong>Controls</strong></em> are objects and therefore have lots of structure to them.&nbsp;   We can set font styles, background colors, sizes, text properties, visibility   states, etc.</p>
	<p><em><strong>Unstructured drawing</strong></em> represents graphical operations that have no associated objects. We simply <em>grab</em> a <strong>Graphics</strong> object, <strong>g</strong>, and use it to invoke various   drawing methods (<strong>g.drawString(), g.fillRect()</strong>, etc.).</p>
	<p><em><strong>Drawing</strong></em> is a lot more chaotic, but a lot more fun.&nbsp;   Everything from sketching applications to 3-D game simulation involves drawing.</p>
	<p>The way we draw is to establish a <strong>JPanel</strong> in our program, place it somewhere   on the <strong>JFrame</strong>, and then draw inside that <strong>JPanel</strong>. The <strong>JPanel</strong> can fill up the   entire <strong>JFrame</strong> if we wish, but usually we leave room for other non-drawing <strong>JPanels</strong> in the frame that can hold objects like buttons, text   fields, menus or other <strong>Controls</strong> for the user to select.</p>
	<p>In order to draw on a <strong>JPanel</strong>, you must derive your own <strong>JPanel</strong> subclass and   override the <strong>paintComponent() </strong>instance method.&nbsp; Here are the key   things to know about this process.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Whenever the <strong>JPanel</strong> is created, resized, or damaged, the <strong>paintComponent()</strong> method is automatically called.</li>
		<li>Whatever drawing commands you put into the <strong>paintComponent()</strong> method will   	be executed each time the panel needs to be refreshed per item 1, above.</li>
		<li><strong>JPanel</strong> receives a graphics context, known as a <em> <strong>Graphics object</strong></em>, as a   	parameter.&nbsp; We usually call this <strong>g</strong>.</li>
		<li>The various graphics methods use <strong>g</strong> as a means of dereference.&nbsp; In   	fact, most of the  drawing functions are <em>instance methods</em> of the <strong>Graphics</strong> class, which is why <strong>g</strong> is used to get to them.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Enough talk, here is an example of a properly extended <strong>JPanel</strong> class with a <strong>paintComponent()</strong> method overridden:</p>

<pre>class DrawingPanel extends JPanel
{
   protected void paintComponent( Graphics g )
   {
      super.paintComponent(g);   // always do this!
      int reasonableWidth, reasonableHeight;
      
      // We'll draw object at 90% size of this JPanel
      reasonableWidth = (int) (getWidth() * .9);
      reasonableHeight = (int) (getHeight() * .9);
      
      // draw some things in various colors
      g.setColor(new Color(120, 221, 90));
      g.drawOval(5, 5, reasonableWidth, reasonableHeight); 
      
      g.setColor(new Color(255, 255, 255));
      g.drawString(
            "This is going to be wild!", 5, reasonableHeight/2);
      
      g.setColor(new Color(39, 210, 255));
      g.fillRect(reasonableWidth/2, reasonableHeight/2, 30, 30);
   }
}
</pre>

	<p>The above panel can be instantiated and placed anywhere in your main   application.&nbsp; Here is an example where we place it in the center section of   a <strong>JFrame</strong> organized as <strong>BorderLayout</strong>:</p>
	<div class="picCenter"><img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 5_files/pic_1b6_9.jpg" alt="GUI shot" width="300" height="200" border="0"></div>
	<p>Here is what we see, looking at the code and the screen shot (focus only on   the center JPanel):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We are calling <strong>super()</strong> to get at the base class version of the <strong>paintComponent()</strong> method.&nbsp; This is essential, as it clears the <strong>JPanel</strong> so   	we can write on a clean slate.</li>
		<li>If we want drawing to be proportional to the size of the <strong>JPanel</strong>,   	we must retrieve the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> through the <strong>getWidth() </strong>and<strong> getHeight() </strong>methods.&nbsp; These two methods can be dereferenced through   	any component to get the dimensions of that component.&nbsp; Calling them   	without dereference uses the implied this to get the dimensions of the   	object whose method we are in -- in this case a <strong>JPanel</strong>.</li>
		<li>We call <strong>g.setColor()</strong> to establish the drawing color.&nbsp; This   	can be changed as often as we want.&nbsp; It affects any future drawing, not   	what has already been drawn.&nbsp; The Color constructor (seen here as an   	anonymous object call inside <strong>setColor()</strong>) It take red-green-blue components from 0   	to 255.&nbsp; black is (0,0,0).&nbsp; White is (255, 255, 255).&nbsp; The   	first number indicates the brightness of red, the second, green, and the   	third, blue.</li>
		<li>The <strong>draw() </strong>routines usually take x and y as two parameters.&nbsp;   	(x, y) represents the coordinates where the   	rectangle, oval, text, etc. is to be anchored .&nbsp; X is the horizontal distance   	in pixels from the upper left corner of the <strong>JPanel</strong> and y is the   	vertical distance in pixels from that same point.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>An example is </p>

<pre>   fillRect( int x, int y, int w, int h)
</pre>

	<p>where <strong>x, y</strong> is the upper left position of the filled rectangle to be drawn and <strong>w, h </strong>are the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> of that same rectangle.&nbsp; In the above example   I used 90% of the width and height of the <strong>JPanel</strong> for the parameters <strong>w </strong>and<strong> h</strong>.&nbsp;   I set the <strong>x-y</strong> position of each of the three drawing methods at different   locations.</p>
	<h2>6A.5.2 The Entire Listing</h2>
	<p>Here is the whole program.&nbsp; It is structured much like our previous <strong> JFrame</strong> GUI applications.&nbsp; I have created a GUI for the various <strong> JComponents</strong> including the <strong> JPanel</strong>, and have drawn using the <strong>JPanel</strong> subclass I defined above.&nbsp;   However, the <strong>JButtons</strong> are as-of-yet, non-functional.&nbsp; They are placed there   in preparation of some event handling that we will do shortly.</p>
	<p>But before we do that extraordinarily exciting step, you have to understand <strong>JPanels</strong> and the way to draw on them.&nbsp; So study this program, try it   and modify it.</p>

<pre>import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
   
public class Foothill
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      // establish main frame in which program will run
      GraphicsFrame myGraphicsFrame = 
         new GraphicsFrame("Graphics Thing");
      myGraphicsFrame.setSize(300, 200);
      myGraphicsFrame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
      myGraphicsFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(
            JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
      
      // show everything to the user
      myGraphicsFrame.setVisible(true);
   }
}

// GraphicsFrame class is derived from JFrame class
class GraphicsFrame  extends JFrame
{
   private JButton btnLine, btnOval, btnRectangle;
   private JPanel pnlButtonPanel;
   DrawingPanel pnlDrawingPanel;
   private JLabel lblMyLabel;
   
   // constructor
   public GraphicsFrame(String title)
   {
      // pass the title up to the JFrame constructor
      super(title);
      
      // set layout
      BorderLayout layout = new BorderLayout(15, 2);          
      setLayout(layout);
      
      // title goes on NORTH of layout
      lblMyLabel = new JLabel("Push a button and have some fun.");

      // create buttons to go on south panel
      btnLine = new JButton("Line"); 
      btnOval = new JButton("Oval"); 
      btnRectangle = new JButton("Rectangle"); 
      
      // create button panel and add buttons
      pnlButtonPanel = new JPanel();
      pnlButtonPanel.setLayout( 
            new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER, 10, 8));
      pnlButtonPanel.add(btnLine);
      pnlButtonPanel.add(btnOval);
      pnlButtonPanel.add(btnRectangle);
      
      // create  drawing panel
      pnlDrawingPanel = new DrawingPanel();
      pnlDrawingPanel.setBackground(new Color(200, 43, 79));
      
      add(lblMyLabel, BorderLayout.NORTH);
      add(pnlDrawingPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
      add(pnlButtonPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);    
   }
}

class DrawingPanel extends JPanel
{
   protected void paintComponent( Graphics g )
   {
      super.paintComponent(g);   // always do this!
      int reasonableWidth, reasonableHeight;
      
      // We'll draw object at 90% size of this JPanel
      reasonableWidth = (int) (getWidth() * .9);
      reasonableHeight = (int) (getHeight() * .9);
      
      // draw some things in various colors
      g.setColor(new Color(120, 221, 90));
      g.drawOval(5, 5, reasonableWidth, reasonableHeight); 
      
      g.setColor(new Color(255, 255, 255));
      g.drawString(
            "This is going to be wild!", 5, reasonableHeight/2);
      
      g.setColor(new Color(39, 210, 255));
      g.fillRect(reasonableWidth/2, reasonableHeight/2, 30, 30);
   }
