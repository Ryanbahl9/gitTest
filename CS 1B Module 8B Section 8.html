	<h1>Section 8 - Raw Types</h1>
	<h2>8B.8.1 Raw Types</h2>
	<p>We conclude (finally) by showing an example of something called a "raw type".&nbsp;   This term refers to a Generic Framework Implementation that is not handed a <em> <strong>type   parameter</strong></em>.&nbsp; For example, say we want a linked list, but want it to contain   a menagerie of object types (some <strong>Dogs</strong>, some <strong>Stars</strong>, some <strong>Pizzas</strong>, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;   We can actually do this:</p>

<pre>   LinkedList  mixedList = new LinkedList();
</pre>

	<p>and all we'll get from the compiler is a slap on the wrist - a <em>warning</em> that   we are instantiating a <em><strong>raw type</strong></em> and uses <em><strong>unchecked or unsafe operations</strong></em>.&nbsp;   This means that the compiler won't be able to tell us if we are adding a valid   object to this list since we haven't told it what kind of object we are planning   to add.&nbsp; But, of course, that's the point.&nbsp; We want to add multiple   types.</p>
	<p>We can get around this warning by feeding the beast the type <em><strong>Object</strong></em>.&nbsp; This doesn't really make the program any safer, but at least it   shuts up the compiler warnings.&nbsp; It will still be our responsibility to   figure out what kind of objects we are removing or returning from the list.&nbsp;   In some cases, this doesn't matter.&nbsp; In the example below, we are using the   list to store a multi-type bunch of things (numbers and Strings), and we will   only make use of the <strong>toString() </strong>method which is included in most classes,   meaning we can apply it to any object we take off the list:</p>

<pre>import java.util.*;

public class Foothill
{
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      LinkedList&lt;Object&gt;  mixedList = new LinkedList&lt;Object&gt;();
      ListIterator&lt;Object&gt;  p;
      
      mixedList.add(37);
      mixedList.add("Hi Mom");
      mixedList.add("Hey - Who's In Charge Here?");
      mixedList.add(-45);
      
      String aString = "Something to Delete";
      mixedList.add(aString);
    
      System.out.println("----------- Original List -------- ");    
      for (p = mixedList.listIterator(); p.hasNext(); )
         System.out.println(p.next().toString()); 
      
      mixedList.remove(aString);
         
     System.out.println("----------- Updated List -------- ");    
     for (p = mixedList.listIterator(); p.hasNext(); )
         System.out.println(p.next().toString());
   }
 }

/* --------------- Sample Run ----------------------

----------- Original List -------- 
37
Hi Mom
Hey - Who's In Charge Here?
-45
Something to Delete
----------- Updated List -------- 
37
Hi Mom
Hey - Who's In Charge Here?
-45

------------------------------------------------- */

	<p>You'll notice that along with the dumbed-down raw-like <strong>LinkedList</strong>, we   are also creating raw-like <strong>Iterator</strong>.&nbsp; If you want to use this sort of list with your own objects (and you will),   you would need to implement <strong>toString()</strong> in any class that you send to the list.</p>
	<p>If you wanted to do something special with the items that you were taking off   the list, you would have to know what kind of item you had.&nbsp; A clunky, but   valid, way to do this is through use of <strong>instanceof</strong>:</p>

<pre>   genericObj = p.next();
   if ( genericObj instanceof PizzaOrder )
   {
      pizzaOrder = (PizzaOrder)genericObj;
      pizzaOrder.DisplayPizza();
   }
</pre>

	<p>And, that's all.</p>
