  	<h1>Section 3 - More on Comparable</h1>
	<h2>7A.3.1 Type Parameters</h2>
	<p>There is one idea we can introduce now that would have made the <strong>Card</strong> <strong>compareTo()</strong> implementation shorter.&nbsp; My presentation implied that   the&nbsp; parameter of the <strong>compareTo()</strong> method had to be an <strong>Object</strong>,   i.e., the "basest" of classes.&nbsp; I used <em><font color="#FF0000">type coercion</font></em> and <font color="#FF0000"><strong>instanceof</strong></font> to force things to work for us in the case of <strong>Cards</strong>.&nbsp; In fact, you can use any class in this position <em>without</em> type   coercion if you   declare this up front as in</p>
<pre>     class Card implements Comparable&lt;Card&gt;</pre>
	
	<p> The word <strong>Card</strong> inside the angled brackets tells Java that we intend to   	use an object of type <strong>Card</strong> as the parameter of our <strong>compareTo()</strong> method.&nbsp; That enables us to write that method like so:</p>
<pre>public int compareTo(Card otherCard)
{  	
   // remove the first few lines of the old method definition
   ...
   
</pre>
	
	<p>This is an example of a <em><strong>type parameter</strong></em>.&nbsp; We are inserting the <strong>Card</strong> in the angled brackets, &lt; ... &gt;,&nbsp; at the top of the class in   the <em>implements</em> clause (in the phrase <strong>Comparable&lt;Card&gt;</strong>) and we   might have placed <em>any</em> type in that position.&nbsp; We declare that we   will be comparing <strong>Cards</strong> to ... <font color="#FF00FF"><em>drum roll please</em></font> ... <strong>Cards</strong>.&nbsp; It usually makes sense to use the same type as the class   itself, in this case, <strong>Card</strong>, because our intent is to compare one <strong>Card</strong> to another <strong>Card</strong>.&nbsp; However, in some universe we might want to compare <strong>Dogs</strong> to <strong>Cats</strong>, so the <strong>Dog</strong> class might implement <strong> Comparable&lt;Cat&gt;</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange, perhaps, but it is not as   strange as you might guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Why is this called a type <em>parameter</em>?&nbsp;&nbsp;   In a manner of speaking, we are "passing" the <strong>Card</strong> type down into the <strong> Comparable</strong> interface definition, just as we pass an argument to a function.&nbsp;&nbsp;   When can we use <em><strong>type parameters</strong></em>?&nbsp; Whenever an interface&nbsp;   was created with one.&nbsp; This means that <strong>Comparable</strong> was defined using   a type parameter.&nbsp; If you were to look at the definition of the Java   interface, you would find this to be true.&nbsp; But when we get to <em><strong> generics</strong></em> we will see how it looks when one creates an interface   definition using type parameters.</p>
	<p>As an illustration of using a <em><strong>type parameter</strong></em>, and a second   example of implementing <strong>Comparable</strong>, think of a class called <strong>LcdTV</strong> which is defined by the <strong>model name</strong> (a <strong>String</strong>) and two <strong>ints</strong> giving the <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> of the viewing area.&nbsp; In most   cases, when we decide whether one <strong>LcdTV</strong> is larger than another (and by   how much) we care about the diagonal length, which is neither the <strong>width</strong> nor the <strong>height</strong>, but rather, <strong>SQRT( width*width + height*height)</strong> as   I'm sure you all recall from the <font color="#008000">Pythagorean Theorem</font>.&nbsp; Ahem.&nbsp; As you see, the idea of one object being compared to another in a   non-obvious way turns up much more common that you might think.</p>
	<p>Here is a class <strong>LcdTV</strong> that implements <strong>Comparable</strong> in a way that   uses a type parameter.<br>
	</p>
 
<pre>class LcdTV implements Comparable&lt;LcdTV&gt;
{   
   // private data
   private String model;
   private int width;  // in inches
   private int height; // in inches
   
   // class constants
   public final int MAX_LENGTH = 20;
   public final int MAX_DIM = 500;
   public final int DEFAULT_DIM = 10;
   
   // constructors
   public LcdTV(String model, int w, int h)
   {
      setModel(model);
      setSize( w, h );
   }
   
   // mutators
   public boolean setModel(String model  )
   {
      if (model==null) 
      {
         this.model = "undefined";
         return false;
      }
      this.model = (model.length() &lt;= MAX_LENGTH)? 
         model : model.substring(0, MAX_LENGTH);
      return true;
   }
   public boolean setSize(int w, int h)
   {
      if (w &lt; 1 || h &lt; 1 || w &gt; MAX_DIM || h &gt; MAX_DIM   )
      {
         width = DEFAULT_DIM;
         height = DEFAULT_DIM;
         return false;
      }
      width = w;
      height = h;
      return true;
   }
   
   // accessors
   public int getHeight()
   {
      return height;
   }
   public int getWidth()
   {
      return width;
   }
   public int getSize()
   {
      return (int)Math.sqrt(height*height + width*width);
   }
      
   // stringizer
   public String toString()
   {
      String retVal;
      
      // convert from char to String
      retVal =  model + " (size = "
         + Integer.toString(getSize()) + ") ";
      return retVal;
   }
   
   // compareTo - the main attraction
   public int compareTo(LcdTV other) 
   {
      return this.getSize() - other.getSize();
   }
} 

public class Foothill
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      LcdTV tv1 = new LcdTV( "Matsashtiku M7", 18, 13);
      LcdTV tv2 = new LcdTV( "GQ S-91", 21, 12);
      LcdTV tv3 = new LcdTV( "Matsashtiku M44", 25, 55);
      LcdTV tv4 = new LcdTV( "Stony VoyVey", 24, 51);

      System.out.println("Comparing " + tv1.toString() + " and "
            + tv2.toString() + ": " 
            + Integer.toString(tv1.compareTo(tv2)));
 
      System.out.println("Comparing " + tv4.toString() + " and "
            + tv3.toString() + ": " 
            + Integer.toString(tv4.compareTo(tv3)));
   }
}

/* --------------------- The Run ------------------------

	<h2>7A.3.2 Comparable and Algorithms</h2>
	<p>Not&nbsp; only is it useful to implement <strong>Comparable</strong> but in some   situations it is required.&nbsp; As we learn about <strong>generics</strong> and <strong>collections</strong>,   we will also see that there are some built-in algorithms in the <em>Java   Collections Framework</em>.&nbsp; Some of these algorithms are applicable   if and only if the class to which they are going to be applied <em><strong>implements</strong></em> <strong> Comparable</strong>.&nbsp; As a quick way to understand this, imagine a method   called <strong>sort()</strong> that sorts a list of objects in any class or one called <strong> add()</strong> that inserts an object in its "correct" place in a sorted list.&nbsp;   Such methods exist but can only be   applied to classes that implement <strong>Comparable </strong>(or <strong>Comparator</strong>, a   similar interface about which we will learn more later).&nbsp; This makes it   important for certain classes to implement <strong>Comparable </strong>for potential   future use with these algorithms..</p>
