  	<h1>Section 3 - The .html File</h1>
	<h2>6A.3.1 The .html File</h2>
	<p> I   said that every applet is associated with an <strong>.html</strong> file that helps load it.&nbsp;   If so, where is the <strong>.html</strong> file associated with the <strong>Foothill</strong> applet, and what would it look like?&nbsp;   </p>
	<p>It could be an <strong>.html </strong>file that contains nothing but  this:</p>

<pre> &lt;APPLET CODE="Foothill" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=500&gt;
  &lt;param name="first" value="Foothill College"&gt;
  &lt;param name="second" value="CS 1B"&gt;
 &lt;/APPLET&gt; 
</pre>

	<p>Or, it might be a larger file that has this as a small section.</p>
	<p>The <strong>height</strong> and <strong>width</strong> are set to <strong>200</strong> and <strong>500</strong>, and there are two <em><strong>parameters</strong></em> named <strong>first</strong> and <strong>second</strong> using the <strong>name=</strong> tag. Their <em><strong>values</strong></em> are assigned using the <strong>value=</strong> tag next to each parameter.</p>
	<p>In a real-world application, an applet may be lanched merely by opening the <strong>.html</strong> page that contains this code in your browser. However, this requires security configurations that we won't cover in our course. Insetead, we have to simulate the file in <strong><em>Eclipse</em></strong>.</p>
	<h2>6A.3.2 Getting the Parameters From the .html File</h2>
	<p>An applet associated with the <strong>.html</strong> file above would acquire the <em><strong>parameters</strong></em> through the <strong>getParameter()</strong> method. The size (<strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong>) of the applet window are automatically applied by the applet.</p>
	<p>The <strong><em>applet source</em></strong> that uses this hypothetical<strong> .html</strong> file might look like:</p>
    
<pre>import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.Graphics;
  
public class Foothill extends Applet
{
   String message;
   String param1, param2;
   
   public void init() 
   {
      message = new String("Hi Java World.");
      
      // get the arguments from the simulated "html" file.
      param1 = getParameter("first");
      param2 = getParameter("second");
   }
  
   public void paint( Graphics g ) 
   {
      g.drawString( message, 30, 30 );
      g.drawString( "1st Param: " + param1, 30, 70 );
      g.drawString( "2st Param: " + param2, 30, 110 );
   }
}
    </pre>
	<p>Here's the run:</p>
    <div class="picCenter"> <img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 3_files/appletPic5.JPG" alt="applet1">    </div>
	<h2>6A.3.3 Simulating the .html file in Eclipse</h2>
	&nbsp;<p></p>
	<p><strong><em>Eclipse</em></strong> simulates a default <strong>.html </strong>file for you. The parameters that normally go into that <strong>.html</strong> file are set in the <strong>Run Configurations</strong> menu:</p>
    <div class="picCenter"> <img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 3_files/appletPic1.JPG" width="328" height="305" alt="run cofig 1">    </div>
	<p>You can set the size of the window as shown:</p>
    <div class="picCenter"> <img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 3_files/appletPic2.JPG" width="408" height="206" alt="run config 2">    </div>
	<p>To add one or more <em><strong>parameters</strong></em>, click the <strong>Add</strong> button and supply the <em><strong>name</strong></em> and <em><strong>value</strong></em> of each parameter (as a pair):</p>
    <div class="picCenter"> <img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 3_files/appletPic3.JPG" width="517" height="372" alt="run config 3">    </div>
	<p>Here, I set two parameters named <strong>first</strong> and <strong>second</strong> with values that are <strong>Strings</strong> as shown:</p>
    <div class="picCenter"> <img src="./CS 1B Module 6A Section 3_files/appletPic4.JPG" width="397" height="263" alt="run config 4">    </div>
    <div class="picCenter"></div>
    <h2>6A.3.4 Applets and Applications</h2>
	<p>While <strong>Applets</strong> cannot be beat for web-based programming, there is   nothing inherently different about them compared with Swing-based GUI   Applications.&nbsp; Besides the <strong>paint() </strong>and<strong> init()</strong> methods (and   the other, less commonly overridden <strong>stop() </strong>and<strong> start()</strong>), whatever   GUIs and classes you can create in an application, you can also create in an <strong> Applet</strong>.</p>
	<p>Because of this, we are going to complete the remainder of the course using   Swing-based GUI applications, just as we started.&nbsp; They are simpler to   write, faster to execute, and don't have the added complexity of <strong>.html</strong> files.&nbsp;   If you are interested in Applets, a great exercise at any time is to take our   Swing applications and turn them into <strong>Applets</strong>.</p>
	<p>That said, I have some really cool graphics to show you in the next lesson.&nbsp;   You will learn techniques that will enable you to draw all over your friends'   screens, and they won't be able to do anything stop you.</p>
