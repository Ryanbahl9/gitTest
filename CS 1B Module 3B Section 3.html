  	<h1>Section 3 - Ragged 2-D Arrays</h1>
	<h2>3B.3.1&nbsp; A College of Courses</h2>
	<p>We now use a <em><strong>ragged array</strong></em> approach, in which each row of the 2-D array might   be a different length from every other row.&nbsp; Here is the setting:&nbsp; We   have a college that contains several courses.&nbsp; Each course will have a   different number of students (or maximum seats).&nbsp; We will get information   from the user about the number of courses and the number of students in each   course and create a <em><strong>ragged 2-D array</strong></em> of <strong>Strings</strong> based on his responses.</p>
	<p>Our basic data type is a 2-D array reference, but we can't do any   instantiation without first consulting the user.</p>

<pre>   String[][] courseRoster;
</pre>

	<p>We ask the user the first question:&nbsp; "How many courses?" and get <strong>numCourses</strong> as a result.&nbsp;   We will allocate our main array of "rows":</p>

<pre>   System.out.print("How many courses do you want to load: ");
   userChoice = input.nextLine();
   numCourses = Integer.parseInt(userChoice);
   courseRoster = new String[numCourses][];</pre>

	<p>Notice how this is done.  You place the number <strong>numCourses</strong> into   the first brackets, indicating that you know how many rows you want, but you are not   allocating any <strong>Strings</strong> for those rows.&nbsp; You are, strictly speaking,   allocating an empty <strong>String[]</strong> for each element in the array, only. Each element in this 1-D array of references is nothing other than an <em> un-instantiated reference</em> to an, as yet, non-existent <strong>String</strong> array).</p>
	<p>Next, we go into a loop, getting the number of students for each course, and   allocate as we go:</p>

<pre>   for (int k = 0; k &lt; numCourses; k++)
   {
      System.out.print("Number of students in course " + k + ": ");
      userChoice = input.nextLine();
      numStudents = Integer.parseInt(userChoice);
      courseRoster[k] = new String[numStudents];
   }</pre>

	<p>At that point we have a 2-D array of ... what?&nbsp; <strong>String</strong> <em><strong>references</strong></em>.&nbsp; <em>Un-instantiated</em> String references, to be precise. So I will then go into a double loop   (the kind that we always use for 2-D arrays) filling each <strong>String</strong> reference with   a value.</p>

<pre>  for ( course = 0; course &lt; courseRoster.length; course++)
  {
     for ( student = 0; student &lt; courseRoster[course].length; 
           student++)
        courseRoster[course][student] = "lily" + student 
           + " obrien" + course;
     System.out.println();
  }</pre>

	<p>The thing you have to be careful about is this:&nbsp; With <strong>Strings</strong>, we get   the false impression that we are dealing with primitive data types like <strong>doubles</strong> or <strong>ints</strong>.&nbsp; In reality, the assignment statements are pointing the references   to allocated String values - a form of instantiation.&nbsp; With more abstract   user-defined types, we would have to use <strong>new</strong> to create the elements.</p>
	<h2>3B.3.2 A Sample of the Run</h2>
	<p>Here is what we are after:</p>

<pre>How many courses do you want to load: 3
Number of students in course 0: 2
Number of students in course 1: 3
Number of students in course 2: 4</pre>

	<p>and then the console result:</p>

<pre>Course #0 -------------
  [lily0 obrien0]   [lily1 obrien0]
Course #1 -------------
  [lily0 obrien1]   [lily1 obrien1]   [lily2 obrien1] 
Course #2 -------------
  [lily0 obrien2]   [lily1 obrien2]   [lily2 obrien2]   [lily3 obrien2]</pre>

	<h2>3B.3.3 The Listing</h2>
	<p>Here is the full program.&nbsp; I have added some safety to it by embedding   the user input/response with input filter loops to be sure we were getting valid   numbers from the user.&nbsp; This is something you should always do.</p>
